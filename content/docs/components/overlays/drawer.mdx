## Installation

<Install cli='drawer' deps={['react-aria-components', 'framer-motion']} components={['drawer', 'modal']} />

## Drawer with Footer

When you choose to include a footer, be sure to use the drawer body inside the content. This ensures the footer stays fixed at the bottom of the drawer.
