## Basic

A radial chart, also known as a radial bar chart or circular bar chart, is a variation of the traditional bar chart where bars radiate from a central point instead of being aligned horizontally or vertically. Each bar's length corresponds to the value it represents, and the angle around the central point determines the category or grouping.

Radial charts are effective for displaying data that is cyclic or directional, such as time-based trends or periodic data. They offer a visually appealing way to compare values across categories while maintaining a clear connection to a central theme or reference point. Radial charts are often used in dashboards, infographics, and presentations to highlight relationships and trends in data that may not be as effectively communicated through traditional linear charts.
