## Basic

A line chart is a type of graph that displays data as a series of points (markers) connected by straight line segments. It's commonly used to show trends over time or to compare changes in values of different categories. Each point on the chart represents a data value, and the lines between them emphasize the continuity or progression of the data. Line charts are useful for visualizing patterns, identifying trends, and understanding relationships between variables in a clear and straightforward manner. They are widely employed in various fields such as economics, science, finance, and social sciences for data analysis and presentation.
