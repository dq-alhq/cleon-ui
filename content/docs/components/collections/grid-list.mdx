## Basic
A basic grid list's a dope way for your peeps to cruise through a list of stuff. Perfect for pickin' one or multiple items, and even droppin' some row actions.

## Installation

<Install items={['react-aria-components']}/>

<SourceCode toShow={['grid-list', 'checkbox']}/>

## Multiple Selection
By default, if you donâ€™t tweak the selectionMode prop, it's single selection. But, you can switch it up to multiple selection too.

## Drag and Drop
Grid list lets you drag and drop stuff if you roll with the dragAndDropHooks prop and the useDragAndDrop hook. You can drop data on the whole list, on individual items, add new stuff between old ones, or rearrange items.

## Dragging Between Items
You can drag items between items in the grid list.

## Controlled
Grid list can be controlled, meaning the parent component calls the shots on the selection state of each item.

## Render Empty State
Grid list can show an empty state if you use the `renderEmptyState` prop.

## Disabled
If you know the [Tag Group](/docs/components/collections/tag-group) component can be disabled with `isDisabled` for children and `disabledKeys` for the parent, you can do the same with Grid List. Check the example below, "Led Zeppelin" and "The Rolling Stones" are disabled.
<How minW72 toUse="collections/grid-list-disabled-demo" />

If you wanna disable items from the parent, you can use the `disabledKeys` prop like this:
```tsx {5}
<GridList
  items={items}
  aria-label="Select your favorite bands"
  selectionMode="multiple"
  disabledKeys={[2,5]}
  className="min-w-64"
>
  {(item) => <GridList.Item id={item.id}>{item.name}</GridList.Item>}
</GridList>
```
