## Basic

A tag group is a focusable list of labels, categories, keywords, filters, or other items, supporting keyboard navigation, selection, and removal.

## Colors

You can switch up the tag group color by throwing in the `color` prop. But right now, only the default blue matches the selected color. The color comes from the badge component. If you want, check out the available colors in the [badge docs](/design-system/statuses/badge).

```
<TagGroup color="amber"/>
```
