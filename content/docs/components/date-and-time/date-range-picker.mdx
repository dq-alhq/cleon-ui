## Basic

A range calendar shows one or more date grids and lets users pick a range of dates in one go.

## Installation

<Install items={['react-aria-components', 'lucide-react']} />

<SourceCode toShow={['date-picker', 'date-field', 'popover', 'field', 'calendar', 'button', 'dialog']} />

## Controlled
Wanna boss around your date picker? Easy peasy. Just throw a value prop at it, and bam, it'll lock in on that date range picker.

## Validation
If you wanna make sure your date picker is filled out, just throw a `isRequired` prop at it.

## Custom Validation
The `validate` function's the real MVP when you wanna check your own rules. It peeps at the current date value and spits back a string or some strings loaded with error messages if the value's off.

## Disabled

When a date range picker is disabled, it cannot be interacted with and is visually indicated by a disabled state.
