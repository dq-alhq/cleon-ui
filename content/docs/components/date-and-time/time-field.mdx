## Basic

A time field lets users type in and tweak time values using a keyboard. Each chunk of a time value is shown in its own editable bit.

## Hour Cycles

You can use the `hourCycle` prop to change the order of the hours in the time field.

## Validation
If you wanna make sure your date picker is filled out, just throw a `isRequired` prop at it.

## Controlled
When a time field is controlled, it will not be editable by the user. The value must be passed in as a prop.

## Disabled

When a time field is disabled, it cannot be interacted with and is visually indicated by a disabled state.
