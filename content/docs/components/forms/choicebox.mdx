## Basic
The Choicebox is an enhanced version of a Radio or Checkbox, offering users a larger tap target and additional details.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="forms/choicebox-demo" />

## Installation

<Install cli='choicebox' deps={['react-aria-components']} components={['choicebox', 'field']}/>

## Single Selection
Although the Choicebox defaults to allowing multiple selections, it can be configured for single selection by setting the `selectionMode` prop.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="forms/choicebox-single-selection-demo" />

## Columns and Gap
The default layout for the Choicebox includes two columns with a 16px gap between items. These settings can be adjusted by passing the `columns` and `gap` props.
<How isCenter={false} withNoPadding={true} toUse="forms/choicebox-columns-demo" />

## Controlled
This component can function as either controlled or uncontrolled. For controlled use, provide the `selectedKeys` prop and manage updates with the `onSelectionChange` event handler.
<How isCenter={false} toUse="forms/choicebox-controlled-demo" />

## Disabled
Disable the entire Choicebox by applying the `isDisabled` prop.
<How isCenter={false} withNoPadding={true} toUse="forms/choicebox-disabled-demo" />

Individual items can also be disabled by specifying their keys in the `disabledKeys` prop.

```tsx
<Choicebox disabledKeys={['sm', 'lg']} />
```
