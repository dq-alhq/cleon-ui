                <Accordion.Content>
                    A VPS is a Virtual Private Server, which provides dedicated resources
                    on a server shared with other users, offering more control and
                    customization than shared hosting.

                <Accordion.Trigger>What is cloud hosting?</Accordion.Trigger>
                <Accordion.Content>
                    Cloud hosting utilizes multiple servers to balance load and maximize
                    uptime. Instead of being hosted on a single server, your data and
                    resources are spread across multiple servers.

                <Accordion.Trigger>What is shared hosting?</Accordion.Trigger>
                <Accordion.Content>
                    Shared hosting is a type of web hosting where multiple websites share
                    the same server and its resources. It's an affordable option, but may
                    have limitations on performance and customization.

                <Accordion.Trigger>What is dedicated hosting?</Accordion.Trigger>
                <Accordion.Content>
                    Dedicated hosting means your website is hosted on a single server
                    exclusively reserved for your site. This provides maximum performance
                    and customization, but at a higher cost.
